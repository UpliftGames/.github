[Uplift Games](https://uplift.games) is a modern, remote-first game studio based in North America and the UK. We develop Adopt Me, the most-played game on the popular Roblox platform. Together our diverse and talented team of Metaverse experts and wider industry veterans are creating future nostalgia for our millions of players.

We are a small, growing studio, and while we aren’t perfect, we strive every day to build the sort of studio we always wished we could work for. A place where unforgettable AAA-scale experiences can be created with an independent spirit, by people who live happy and healthy lives.

## We make Adopt Me! 🐶🐱🐉
[Adopt Me](https://playadopt.me) is the most-played Roblox game of all time. Players explore a family-friendly online world where they can build and decorate houses, adopt over 150 cute pets, and use in-game tools to create their own emergent fun with friends.
